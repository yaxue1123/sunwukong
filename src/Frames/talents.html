               <p class = "para"><em><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">Sun Wukong</a></em>'s 
                primary weapon is the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruyi_Jingu_Bang">"Ruyi Jingu Bang"</a>, 
                which he can shrink down to the size of a needle and 
                keep in his ear, as well as expand it to gigantic proportions. 
                The rod, which weighs 17,550 pounds, was originally a pillar 
                supporting the undersea palace of the Dragon King of the East Sea. 
                The Dragon King, unwilling to see a monkey making troubles 
                in his favourite place, also gave him a suit of golden armour. 
                These gifts, combined with his devouring of the peaches of 
                immortality, three jars of elixir, and his time being tempered 
                in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Laozi</a>'s Eight-Trigram Furnace (he gained a steel-hard body 
                and fiery golden eyes that could see very far into the distance 
                and through any disguise. He is therefore always able to 
                recognise a demon in disguise while the rest of the pilgrimage 
                cannot. However, his eyes become weak to smoke), makes Sun 
                Wukong the strongest member of the pilgrimage by far. Besides 
                these abilities, he can also pluck hairs from his body and 
                blow on them to convert them into whatever he wishes (usually 
                clones of himself to gain a numerical advantage in battle). 
                Although he is a master of the 72 methods of transformation 
                and can transform into anything that exists (animate and inanimate), 
                he can use his "somersault cloud" enabling him to travel 18,000 meters 
                in a single leap (he is also able to fly without use of the cloud). 
                The monkey, nimble and quick-witted, uses these skills to defeat 
                all but the most powerful of demons on the journey.</p>
